Conclusion:
Based on the housing market analysis in San Francisco during the period between 2010 and 2016, gross rent increased significantly across nearly all neighborhoods, but sale prices had relatively small fluctuations over the time period.  The potential the for one-click, buy-and-rent strategy could be a good investment in San Franciso because while gross rent has seen signficant and steady increases each year, the sale prices have remained about the same.  This means that a rental property could be purchased at a relatively low price compared to the rent price that could be collected.
